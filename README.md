# env-config

This is my personal Linux environment configuration. 

I am trying to organize my dev workflow according to unix software
principle, which states that each program should be used for one
thing and one thing only. 

Tools that I wish to configure
- kitty (terminal emulator)
- tmux (terminal multiplexer)
- neovim (text editor for programming)
- yazi (command line file manager)
- lazygit (for managing git repos)
